## 🏗️ Embedded Design Layers  

1. **Hardware Layer** – ATmega32A, peripherals, sensors, and actuators.  
2. **Device Drivers (HAL)** – Register-level drivers providing simple functions (GPIO, UART, SPI, etc.).  
3. **Middleware** – Protocols, libraries, or additional services built on top of drivers.  
4. **OS Layer (optional)** – RTOS or scheduler for task management.  
5. **Application Layer** – Main program implementing system logic.
